 # Full static wedding website

 Because I am known as the **computer guy** of my family (even though I am a simple machine learning engineer and probably the worse front dev), I was asked to build a website for my cousin wedding. 

 The website built is full static and hosted on AWS S3 (cheapest option I found).

 Check the website at http://stephanie-et-brice.com/
 
 ## Form to email
 One difficulty I faced was to send infos from a form to my couins email.
 To solve I used *Google Apps Mail*
